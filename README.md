# Speech Therapy Project

Welcome to the **Speech Therapy Project**! This project is designed to assist individuals in improving their speech and pronunciation through interactive exercises and tools. It is a simple yet effective application aimed at making speech therapy accessible and engaging.

## Current Features

- **Repeat after me**: Users can practice speech exercises by repeating the sentences.

## My Aspirations

We are planning to enhance the project with the following features:

1. **AI-Powered Pronunciation Analysis**: Use machine learning to provide detailed feedback on pronunciation accuracy.
2. **Customizable Exercises**: Allow users or therapists to create custom exercises.
3. **Gamification**: Add rewards and challenges to make the experience more engaging.
4. **Multilingual Support**: Expand the application to support multiple languages.
